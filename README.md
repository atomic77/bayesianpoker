This is a poker-playing REST service using Bayesian statistics. It's currently a sandbox for me to
play with various technologies like Spring Boot, Scala, SBT, Spark and WEKA and isn't yet usable.

It's derived from some old R and Java code I had lying around that originally used 
[samIam](http://reasoning.cs.ucla.edu/samiam/) as the reasoning engine.
